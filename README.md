# Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization


## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization" programming assignment, which is part of the Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai.

## Assignment Details
- **Assignment Type:** Programming
- **Course:** Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

## Objectives
### W1A1 Initialization
W1A1 Initialization/Initialization.ipynb. In this notebook, the objective is to apply initialization techniques to improve the learning process.

### W1A2 Regularization
W1A2 Regularization/Regularization.ipynb. In this notebook, L2 regularization and dropout are applied to a deep learning model recommending strategic positions for football players. The goal is to avoid overfitting and provide better recommendations to the goalkeeper.

Make sure to follow the instructions in the "How to Use" section of the README to run these notebooks.
